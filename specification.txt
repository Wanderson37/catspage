lists the 10 HTML tags and 5 CSS properties youâ€™ve used, as well as a brief (one-sentence) description of how you chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap.
1.<h1> for title home
2.<h3> for names the cats
3.<img> for image the cats
4.<a> to link a page for individual cats
5.<div> for separe in containers
6.<p> to add description
7.<ul> create a list
8.<li> create a itens of the list
9.<video> add a video
10.<span> to create a line text

I use JavaScript to create an alert for users about "Careful! Cuteness alert!!!" because the page is much cute.

I use bootstrap for some properties in tags <div> and <h1> for pratically and looks better and responsive
